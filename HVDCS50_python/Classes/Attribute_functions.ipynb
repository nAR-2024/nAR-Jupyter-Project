    "The syntax and parameters for these functions\n",

    "default : the value that is returned if the attribute does not exist (note: this parameter is optional)\n",

    "Above, we checked if the attributeless object has the attribute .fake_attribute. Since it does not, hasattr() returned False. After that, we used getattr to attempt to retrieve .other_fake_attribute. Since .other_fake_attribute isn’t a real attribute on attributeless, our call to getattr() returned the supplied default value 800, instead of throwing an AttributeError.\n",
