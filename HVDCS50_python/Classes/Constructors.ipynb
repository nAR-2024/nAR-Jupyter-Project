    "underscores (double-underscore abbreviated to “dunder”) on either side of them.\n",

    "__init__()\n",

    "method (note the two underscores before and after the word “init”). \n",
    "This method is used to initialize a newly created object. It is called every time the class is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods that are used to prepare an object being instantiated are called constructors. \n",
    "The word “constructor” is used to describe similar features in other object-oriented programming languages, \n",
