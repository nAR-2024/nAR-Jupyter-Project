    "Calculating Aggregate Functions I\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a bunch of data, we often want to calculate aggregate statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, percentiles, etc.) over certain subsets of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a grade book with columns student, assignment_name, and grade. The first few lines look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "student\tassignment_name\tgrade\n",
    "Amy\t    Assignment 1\t75\n",
    "Amy  \tAssignment 2\t35\n",
    "Bob \tAssignment 1\t99\n",
    "Bob \tAssignment 2\t35\n",
    "…\t\t\n",
    "We want to get an average grade for each student across all assignments. We could do some sort of loop, but Pandas gives us a much easier option: the method .groupby.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we’d use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "grades = df.groupby('student').grade.mean()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The output might look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "student\tgrade\n",
    "Amy\t    80\n",
    "Bob\t    90\n",
    "Chris\t75\n",
    "…\t\n",
    "In general, we use the following syntax to calculate aggregates:\n",
    "\n",
    "df.groupby('column1').column2.measurement()\n",
