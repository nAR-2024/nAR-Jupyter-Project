    "Binomial events always have 2 possible outcomes, which we refer to as success and failure. \n",

    "The output from our simulation is a list of 0’s and 1’s. This is the number of successes in each experiment. \n",
    "In this case, since we are simulating a single trial, 1 would mean the outcome of the trial was a \n",
    "success and 0 would mean the outcome was a failure.\n",
    "\n",
