    "This convenience is most apparent when the constructor creates the instance variables using the arguments passed into it. \n",

    "We then create the codecademy instance of SearchEngineEntry by passing the URL as an argument to the constructor. \n",

    "Similarly, wikipedia.url holds the value that was passed into the constructor when wikipedia was defined.\n",
